Magneticmediajs is a JavaScript and CSS solution to display media content in a stylish mobile-ready overlay fashion. It includes designs for e-commerce, media gallery and also lets you ingest content from today's most popular media platform: Youtube, Instagram, Vimeo, Flickr, Dailymotion. 

Magneticmediajs is built with a JavaScript pseudo-class model for easier work of extension, jQuery for DOM manipulation and Less CSS3 with progressive enhancement. It comes with a documented API to control your media and provides callback capabilities. Magneticmediajs completely embraces the mobile experience: it supports various touch events, including swipes between media items, and scales well from mobile devices (iOS, Android ...) to large computer screens. Plus it has some super cool design effects for images including a magnifying glass and 8 filters (sepia, grayscale, saturate ...).
